## App Review Notes (paste draft)

Calvary Caravan is a retreat convoy coordination app.

How to test quickly:
1. Open app and enter retreat code: `APPLE26` (or current review code).
2. Enter a display name and join the retreat.
3. Open the group status/map/chat areas to verify participant updates and messaging.

Important behavior:
- Location permissions are required for live convoy visibility.
- If network service is weak, updates resume automatically when service returns.

If your team needs an alternate test code or assistance during review, contact us at the App Review contact above.

## Pre-submit reminders

- Ensure the review retreat code is active in production before clicking Submit for Review.
- Keep that review code active until review completes.
- If flow changes, update these notes before submission.
